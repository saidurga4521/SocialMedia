## Project Description

- This project is a social media application that allows users to interact with each other by creating and sharing posts. Users can upload content, like posts, and share their thoughts through comments. Additionally, I implemented features for profile management, enabling users to update their profile information directly. Users can also edit their previously shared posts, making the platform more dynamic and user-friendly.
